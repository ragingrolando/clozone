# Clozone

Clozone is a little game inspired by the famous Dots and Boxes. It is deployed via OpenShift at https://clo.zone. Don't hesitate to fork it and improve it, pull requests are very welcome!

## Notes

This project is not licensed yet, as I'm not sure which license to choose: let me know if you think of one that could match.

You'll notice that I haven't put a lot of efforts into the HTML/CSS, first because it kind of bores me, but also and especially because the initial purpose was to play with ES6 and PWA. Feel free to improve the finish if you have an UI/UX-enhanced brain!

## Run it

```text
npm install
npm run watch
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000 and enjoy :)
